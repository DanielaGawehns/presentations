\begin {frame}{The Why }

What makes those activity trackers so attractive?

\begin {itemize}
    \item tracking of activity, heart rate, location, interactions, momentary emotional assessment
    \item passively, (almost) non-intrusive
    \item longitudinal studies (several weeks)
    \item real life data
\end {itemize}

%Speakernotes:

%At exodus, ex detainees get coaching to build a new life after prison. This includes making plans and monitoring that coachees stay out of prison.

%This is traditionally done with personal sessions and via phone calls.

%Wearables could help clients at exodus to gain more insights about their own behavior and give them feedback about their behavior. Depending on the clients wishes, coachees could have their coach call them if they stayed insight for too long and fear that this triggers a spiral of depression and drug abuse. Or, going even further, the wearable could monitor which calls are made from the mobile phone and if a set of numbers is or is not called, the coach gets a message and reminds the coachee to call their support system or asks what made them get in touch with criminal circles again.

\item Partner with the Apple Research App %props totally not possible unless you'r Harvard or MIT
\item Researchkit and Carekit frameworks 
\pause
	\begin {itemize}
	\item access health data, access to "tasks" and their outcomes
	\item bring your own data storage (?!)

%https://www.researchandcare.org

%Investigator Support Program to get watches for your study

%Researchkit: Tasks (e.g., Stroop Task, Walk as quick as you can)
%		     No background data collection
		     
%Healthkit: Access Health data via this kit

%CoreMotion: "Core Motion reports motion- and environment-related data from the onboard hardware of iOS devices, including from the accelerometers and gyroscopes, and from the pedometer, magnetometer, and barometer."

%--> open questions: 
%will data be sent only btw app and researcher?
%which temporal granularity of raw sensor data output is achievable?
%what is the reliability/ validity of the in-built cognitive assessments?


%General: Investigator Support Pilot and Apple watch limited grant program

%		http://researchkit.org
%		https://github.com/researchkit/researchkit
%		https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/217/
%		docs: http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/Overview/GuideOverview.html
		 
%		 Tasks: seven categories: motor activities, fitness, cognition, speech, hearing, hand 				dexterity, and vision
%		 All from Clinical Neuropsychology - Cognitive and fitness testing activities
%		 the clinician in me asks: are those validated tests? Validated againsts paper-pen tests or lab tests that those are based on 
		 
%		 It might be returning the raw accelerometer information collected during those tasks (???)
%		 You can also design your own test (?)
		 
		
%		ResearchKit framework currently doesnt include:

%Background sensor data collection. APIs like HealthKit and CoreMotion on iOS already support this.
%Secure communication mechanisms between your app and your server; you will need to provide this.
%The ability to schedule surveys and active tasks for your participants.
%A defined data format for how the ResearchKit framework structured data is serialized. All the ResearchKit framework objects conform to the NSSecureCoding protocol, and sample code exists protocol, and sample code exists outside the framework for serializing objects to JSON.

%Healthkit - needed to access users health data and information: 
%		demographics, workout information (?) but where is the sensor data?

%CoreMotion - 
%docs: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion
%Core Motion reports motion- and environment-related data from the onboard hardware of iOS devices, including from the accelerometers and gyroscopes, and from the pedometer, magnetometer, and barometer.
%	Accelerometer, 
%	Gyroscope,

%	Pedometer,

%Looking into Accelerometer: value of recording interval seems to depend on hardware? ??
%Interesting finding: they have a function and objects to monitor movement disorders, namely tremors

\begin {frame}{The How - Fitbit}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use Fitabase  %a company providing research support
\item Use web API %- extract customer data per participant 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Companion Application to Watch Application file transfer  %can this be done via a private network? fetch API seems to allow this - at least that's what the docs say
	\item locked in certification  %private apps need to go through publishing process? you might be able to play the system and have several dev accounts and associated dev watches with it - only possible on some, not all watches: Fitbit Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2, and Ionic.
	\end{itemize}
\item Use bulk download via fitbit account %doable for small studies - locked in to what fitbit grants you access to via the companion application
\end {itemize}

%https://healthsolutions.fitbit.com/researchers/
%https://healthsolutions.fitbit.com/researchers/faqs/ %but the accelerometer API DOES give you access to raw accelerometer data??
%https://www.fitabase.com - company providing researchsupport

%broad product lineup with devices that track a variety of metrics, including step count, floors climbed, distance, calories burned, active minutes, sleep time and stages, and heart rate

%Either summary data per account: 
%https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1133.htm

%or via web API for accessing data from Fitbit devices and anyone can develop an application to access data from a device - in higher temporal resolution, including GPS data (Heart Rate, Sleep, Activity Patterns) --> Intraday support can extend the detail-level response to include 1min and 15min for Activity, and 1sec and 1min for Heart Rate
%on researchers/faq:
%Can I access raw accelerometer (or other sensor) data?
%No, this data cannot be accessed. See above for more information on the data you can access and how you can do so.

%--> open questions: 
%Is an offline export of the data possible and supported?
%(i.e. not via web API)
%General  question about the black boxes converting sensor data into activity types or counted steps

\begin{itemize}
\item Use Fitabase - a company providing research support
\item Use the Health API 
\item Use the Health SDK 
\end {itemize}

%https://developer.garmin.com/health-api/overview/ 
%Health API and Health SDK

%Health SDK allows custom recording of Heart Rate, Activity Types - and most probably also accelerometer and gyroscope data (but no confirmation or link information for any of this)


%Health API gives access to a range of data collected, activity types, sleep, heart rate; I am pretty sure that extraction of raw accelerometer data is not possible via this

\begin {frame}{The How - Choices }

"To \textbf{enhance acceptability} and minimize user burden and stigma, widely available consumer-oriented technologies were therefore considered. The user groups favored the wrist-worn Fitbit Charge HR (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco) due to its \textbf{appearance as a lifestyle device} that is acceptable to both younger and older users and the \textbf{ability to view metrics} relating to sleep and activity via the Fitbit app."

\end {frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin {frame}{The How - Choices }
"Do these devices, therefore, have a role as tools for clinical prediction?\\
We suggest that they do, \textbf{depending on the question being asked [58]}. Our goal is not to draw conclusions about sleep parameters (eg, total sleep time, sleep efficiency) per se, for which the use of unvalidated devices would be inappropriate. Rather, our \textbf{objective is to ask whether changes in longitudinal rest-activity patterns} at the within-person level, captured using wearable device and smartphone sensors, \textbf{predict deterioration} in clinical status."

\begin {itemize}
\item Lab Studies \\ \pause bulky, precision technology and access to the raw data
\pause 
\item Big Data Studies \\ \pause  wide spread use of consumer grade devices and access to summary statistics
\pause 
\item Real life Data Collection \\ \pause  if the data supplied by platforms are in accordance with what you want to achieve
